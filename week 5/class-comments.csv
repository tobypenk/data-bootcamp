I like that the class is informative and look forward to it getting more difficult,positive
no critique,positive
"good, I want to learn the latest tech with ai and machine learning",positive
"the content is very substantial, excellent",positive
the patience,positive
chatgpt,positive
I'm basically using this class to have a foundational understanding so I can accurately tell and engineering developer what I need,positive
good examples during lectures,positive
getting insights from professional experience and settings,positive
a lot of really great examples in class,positive
love the shout outs of good homework,positive
"huge fan of the assignments, very fun and reinforces learnings",positive
the pace has been good so far,positive
excellent job teaching and communicating concepts,positive
all things are really great,positive
I like the pace of this class,positive
allowing us to use chatgpt on the homework,positive
working with real data on homework and in class,positive
great pace,positive
useful content and packages,positive
homework is very useful and relevant to class material,positive
how the lecture goes is reall practical and helpful,positive
good amount of homework to do real practice,positive
a little too fast,critical
some parts from homework are not covered in class,critical
going a little slower in class,critical
zooming in on the google colab a little more,critical
too fast,critical
homework hard,critical
showing the code for some more time before scrolling down,critical
"focusing on real world analysis, for instance financial datasets, even by using models if possible",critical
I have no idea how to write any of this without chatgpt,critical
"it's way too fast, maybe I'm just dumb",critical
practical acquire hands-on experience,critical
can you upload the class notebook to the github,critical
too deep into python itself,critical
"having datasets already created rather than having to type them, I feel that would be a more efficient use of time",critical
the homework problems are pretty advanced and take up a lot of time,critical
would love some time where you give us a problem in class and give us a few minutes to try independently,critical
"it would be nice to have the solutions to some of the homework questions that have single answers. Not the coding, just the end result. Helps to see if you are on the right track.",critical
nothing bad comes to my mind for now,critical
"I hope we can pull datasets and model on them, web scraping would be very cool please",critical
I resent that this class does not count toward a data analytics degree specialization,critical
I like how project and practice based this class is,critical
