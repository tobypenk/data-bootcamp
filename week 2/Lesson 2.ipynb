    "Last week, we learned that functions can return values to be used by other code. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def double(num):\n",
    "        return 2 * num\n",
    "        \n",

    "        return num ** 2\n",
    "        \n",
    "    x = 5\n",
    "    x_doubled = double(x)\n",
    "    x_doubled_and_squared = square(x_doubled)\n",
    "    \n",
    "This is the power of `return`ing values - they can then be used by other code. Function _parameters_ - the values inside the parentheses - are evaluated first, so this is equivalent to the above (this is referred to as function _composition_):\n",
    "\n",
    "    x_doubled_and_squared = square(double(5))\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can also return multiple values. Just separate the values after the `return` keyword by a comma:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def means(num1,num2):\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        returns the arithmetic and geometric means of two numbers.\n",
    "        inputs: num1, num2; ints or floats to have their means taken.\n",
    "        output: a tuple of floats containing the arithmetic and geometric means, in that order.\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        ari_mean = (num1 + num2) / 2\n",
    "        geo_mean = (num1 * num2) ** 0.5\n",
    "        \n",
    "        return ari_mean, geo_mean\n",
    "        \n",
    "The return values can be assigned, also using commas, like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "There are many, many, many, many things you will want to do in Python that require functionality beyond the few dozen built-in functions Python provides. To service these needs, Python offers modules, some of which are built and maintained by the official Python developers, and others of which are built and maintained by Python's enormous, global, open-source community.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few of the most important libraries:\n",
    "- `math` (mathematical functions)\n",
    "- `pandas` (dataframe package for manipulating spreadsheet-like datasets like csv's)\n",
    "- `numpy` (extensive math library including matrix functions required for statistics)\n",
    "- `scikit-learn` (machine learning package)\n",
    "- `matplotlib` (data viasualization)\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules are added to your code using the `import` keyword:\n",
    "\n",
    "    import math\n",
    "    x = 5.99\n",
    "    x_floor = math.floor(x)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Two principles are customary when it comes to modules:\n",
    "- Don't just import your modules as needed in the code - when you realize the need for a module, add its `import` statement at the top of your code, along with all the other `import` statements for your entire script. This may result in a large number of module import statements; that's totally fine.\n",
    "- Import modules only for the scope they are needed - if a module is used only in one function, it is considered good hygiene to limit that import to the function itself:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    def function_that_uses_some_module():\n",
    "        import some_module\n",
    "        [...]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This way, the module and its functions will be visible only within the function scope, not the global scope. This increases the cleanliness of your _namespace_ - the set of all variable names and pieces of data you've loaded into your script.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Note - if you are trying to use a module but python says it's not found, use `pip` to install it:\n",

However, in Python they can contain anything, including mixed data. The following are legal lists - though I will say, while there's nothing wrong with them, these grab-bags of data do make most developers feel icky:\n",

Tuples are useful for things like constants (e.g., pi) or function return values - things you will use but not modify."
