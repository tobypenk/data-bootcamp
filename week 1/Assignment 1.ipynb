    "- Complete the following code assignments, each in its own cell of a Google Colab notebook. Ensure you handle \"edge\" cases like someone passing a string where a number should be, or testing a negative number for primeness:\n",
    "    - Write a function that takes three parameters: `num1`, `num2`, and `operator`. Write code that executes the given `operator` for the two numbers and returns the result, when given any number as `num1` and `num2`, and any of the following operators as `operator`:\n",

    "    - Create a currency converter: given the first currency amount and the three-letter symbol for the target currency, return the amount of the new currency. Write code that can handle at least 4 different currencies. (You'll need to use Google for this, at the very least to find the conversion rates)\n",
    "    - Devise a loan eligibility calculator: write a function that takes relevant inputs to a loan eligibility decision. Then, implement code that considers these variables and returns a yes/no decision. Comment the code to justify your choice of inputs and logic.\n",

    "- Submit the notebooks you used to solve these problems, either by emailing them to me at tp1488@stern.nyu.edu, or by making me a shared collaborator on your Google Colab notebook.\n",
    "- Install Python and Jupyter on your machine; run your first notebook on your browser and provide a screenshot. As a starting point, here are <a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-jupyter-notebook-on-macos/\">Mac instructions</a> and \n",
