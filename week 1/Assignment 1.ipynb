    "- Complete the following code assignments, each in its own cell of a Google Colab notebook:\n",
    "    - Create three variables: `num1`, `num2`, and `operator`. Write code that executes the given `operator` for the two numbers, when given any number as `num1` and `num2`, and any of the following operators:\n",
    "        - \"add\"\n",

    "    - Create a discount calculator: declare a variable for the price of an item; then, calculate the discount like this: If the price is more than 50, discount by 10%; otherwise, don't give a discount. Print the price at the end.\n",
    "    - Create a currency converter: declare a variable for the first currency amount, and a second variable that is a string giving the new currency symbol. Print the amount of the new currency given these inputs. Write code that can handle at least 4 different currencies. (You'll need to use Google for this, at the very least to find the conversion rates)\n",
    "    - Devise a loan eligibility calculator: declare variables for relevant inputs to a loan eligibility decision. Then, implement code that considers these variables and generates a decision. Comment the code to justify your choice of inputs and logic.\n",
    "    - *Challenge:* make an account on <a href=\"https://projecteuler.net/sign_in\">Project Euler</a> and solve the first problem in the archives. Send me your code.\n",
    "- Submit the notebooks you used to solve these problems, either by emailing them to me at tp1488@stern.nyu.edu, or by making me a shared collaborator on your Google Colab notebook.\n",

    "- Install Python and Jupyter on your machine; run your first notebook on your browser and provide a screenshot\n",
