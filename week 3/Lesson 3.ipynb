But this works for our purposes, for now.\n",

The system of coding we've been working in so far is called _functional_ programming, and it is focused on the relationship between _inputs_ and _outputs_ of functions and data, and the _transformations_ that turn one into the other. The alternative paradigm is called _object-oriented_ programming, and in it, code behavior is mediated by _classes_, which take on semantic meaning similar to how a human might think of objects in the real world. This will make more sense in a second.\n",
