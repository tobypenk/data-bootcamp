    "- Select a dataset\n",
    "- Perform exploratory analysis as we have done in class with datasets like the Titanic survivorship data, including:\n",
    "    - Describing the dataset's columns and rows\n",
    "    - Noting any aspects of the data that might prove challenging for a mathematical model (e.g., lots of missing values in some column; lots of string data that is hard to categorize; etc)\n",

    "    - Dealing with missing data\n",
    "    - Cleaning columns with messy data like inconsistently-formatted strings\n",

    "- Perform feature engineering, including:\n",
    "    - Developing dummy variables for columns with several distinct categories\n",
    "    - Creating derived columns like we did with \"mentions_time\" in our analysis of class commentary\n",
    "    - Again, you don't need to use all the available feature engineering techniques\n",
    "- Present some summary statistics on your data, including:\n",
    "    - How many rows are there? How many contain at least one null / nan value?\n",
    "    - What type of data is contained in each column? How spread out are the values of each column?\n",
    "    - Which columns contain data that could reasonably be predicted if given the data in the other columns?\n",
    "    - What real-world problems could be addressed with your dataset? These could be, but don't have to be, business problems.\n",
    "- Discuss what your dataset can and cannot be used for:\n",
    "    - What business or real-world decisions could be made on the basis of this data?\n",
    "    - What business or real-world decisions could _not_ be made on the basis of this data, and what refinements or additions would the dataset need to be more useful?"
